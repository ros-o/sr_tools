## SR_HAND_HEALTH_REPORT PACKAGE

Package that contains code to run Automatic Health Report tests.

The purpose of the script will be to collect information on the health of the hand at time of manufacture. Clients will then be able to run this script when they suspect a fault or degraded performance of the hand. The script will compare these new results to the results at the time of manufacture in order to provide a health report of the hand, and send this report to shadow for analysis.
